```bash
git clone https://github.com/yujunxian/TECHIN515-magic-wand.git
cd TECHIN515-magic-wand

### 2. Power On and Run

Power on the device (via battery or USB). The three colored LEDs will blink twice, indicating that the device has successfully powered up and initialized.

Press the button to start gesture recognition. Each recognition cycle lasts 1 second, after which the device waits for a new gesture input.

Z → Red LED

O → Blue LED

V → Green LED

No computer connection is required. The device runs standalone and performs real-time classification using the pre-trained Edge Impulse model.
